# Project J.A.R.V.I.S.

## Home Automation Scripts for the Apple computers.

<p><strong>Just A Rather Very Intelligent System,</strong> or <strong>J.A.R.V.I.S.</strong>  is Tony Stark's artificially intelligent  computer. It is programmed to speak with a male voice in a British accent. J.A.R.V.I.S. is now merged with Vision. </p>

<p>J.A.R.V.I.S. is Tony Stark's home computing system, taking care of everything to do with the house, from heating and cooling systems to engine analysis of Stark's hot rod in the garage. J.A.R.V.I.S. was also adapted to be downloaded into the Iron Man Mark II and III armors, to help Tony navigate the systems. </p>
